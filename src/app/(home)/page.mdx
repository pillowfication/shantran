I am currently on the job market for the 2024-2025 academic year. I will be [presenting my job market paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2025/preliminary/2057?q=eNo1jEEKgDAMBP-yZwU9ePEdfqDWUHKoLUlRpPTvpoi32d1hK5RUOZ3bkwlr_SNWzGgDvCsUkjyWMcCpJv9hIYlGu_AR-AzWHK5b87j0lSN93sV091_J2YplQmsvh7kjfQ) at the ASSAs in San Francisco, CA in January 2025.

# Research

<div className='flex flex-wrap gap-4 md:gap-8 mb-4'>
<div className='w-full md:w-7/12'>
My research aims to address gender and geographic inequities in science by identifying factors that promote innovation and regional scientific capacity. I primarily use reduced-form empirical methods, such as using policy changes as quasi-experimental variation and matching methods to identify causal relationships. My work has explored gender disparities in academia, the impact of social policies on researcher productivity, and the role of cultural factors in scientific development.

My job market paper investigates gender differences in the benefits of coauthoring with prominent economists. Using a matched sample design, I find that junior female economists who coauthored with female superstars experience significantly better publication outcomes than those who coauthored with male superstars. This work aims to identify gender-specific factors that shape success in economics publishing. Additionally, I’ve coauthored published papers exploring the factors influencing scientific production in developing countries. These projects have highlighted the impact of research evaluation systems, social trust, and community engagement on the scientific productivity of researchers in Indonesia and Northern Nigeria.

Beyond my research, I’m actively involved in diversity initiatives at my university. As a research assistant for the [ADVANCE Kaulike Catalyst project](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/advance/), I contribute to efforts to address systemic gender inequities in STEM faculty at the University of Hawai‘i.

Star Secrets? Gender differences in the impact of superstar coauthorship in Economics
</span>

<span className='md:text-sm'>
> **Abstract**
>
> The field of economics grapples with a persistent gender gap, with the underrepresentation of women worsening at higher academic ranks (CSWEP, 2020). This paper investigates how gender shapes the benefits of collaboration with highly successful economists, or “superstars.” Specifically, I examine whether early coauthorship with a female superstar has a differential impact on the publication success of junior researchers compared to coauthorship with a male superstar. Using a difference-in-differences with a matched sample design, I find that junior women who coauthor with female superstars experience significantly better publication outcomes compared to those who coauthor with male superstars. In contrast, junior men appear to perform similarly regardless of the gender of their superstar coauthor. These findings suggest that female superstars may offer unique benefits to junior women that encourage publication success. These results highlight the importance of gender-specific factors in shaping success in economics and suggest that ongoing efforts for supporting women in economics should consider gender-specific approaches.

- “[Ranking Researchers: Evidence from Indonesia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733323000379)” _(with John Lynham and Caroline Fry)_, **_Research Policy_**, 2023

<CollapsibleAbstract buttonText='View Abstract' className='md:text-sm'>
> In the span of three years, Indonesia went from being the second-worst to the top producer of scientific journal articles in Southeast Asia. We investigate whether a transparent system of ranking every single researcher in the country based on publications and citations (SINTA) contributed to this turnaround. Using panel data from over 200,000 Indonesian researchers (and comparing to researchers from Thailand and the Philippines), we show that the implementation of SINTA coincides with changes in the production of publications by Indonesian researchers consistent with the weights used in the ranking formula. Although we see modest improvements in publication rates in top-ranked journals, 62% of the observed increase in total publications is from conference proceedings. Because SINTA was launched around the same time as other policies that focused on increasing publications, isolating the precise impact of SINTA remains challenging. Nevertheless, after accounting for such policies, our results imply that a ranking and evaluation system for researchers can contribute to overall improvements in scientific capacity in low- and middle-income countries.

<CollapsibleAbstract buttonText='View Abstract' className='md:text-sm'>
> This study investigates how negative news alleging ethical misconduct in clinical trials can hinder scientific development in emerging economies. We examine a 2000 exposé surrounding a clinical trial conducted in Northern Nigeria, leading to decades of community mistrust in foreign pharmaceutical companies. By comparing scientific output of researchers in affected and less affected regions, we find a significant decline in publication growth, particularly for medical researchers. An exploration of the mechanisms suggests that eroded community support and participation in research and reduced international collaboration contributed to this slowdown. This study highlights the importance of the science-community relationship in fostering scientific development. Our findings imply that a ’social li- cense to operate’ grounded in community trust is essential for scientific progress, and that future research on the determinants of scientific capacity in developing countries should consider community attitudes and involvement.

- “Food for Thought: Can College Pantries Nourish Academic Success?”

<CollapsibleAbstract buttonText='View Abstract' className='md:text-sm'>
> Rising tuition and living expenses have intensified food insecurity among college students, prompting a surge in campus food pantries. This study investigates the impact of these pantries on student success. Using institutional-level panel data, I examine the relationship between pantry establishment and student retention rates. Additionally, an individual-level analysis using instrumental variables will assess the impact of pantry access on student academic performance. By filling this research gap, this study contributes to understanding the efficacy of campus food pantries in addressing student needs and improving academic outcomes.
